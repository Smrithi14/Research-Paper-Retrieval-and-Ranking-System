      "summary": "An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources, and provides common services for computer programs.\n Time-sharing operating systems schedule tasks for efficient use of the system and may also include accounting software for cost allocation of processor time, mass storage, peripherals, and other resources.\n For hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation, the operating system acts as an intermediary between programs and the computer hardware,[1][2] although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an OS function or is interrupted by it. Operating systems are found on many devices that contain a computer\u00a0\u2013 from cellular phones and video game consoles to web servers and supercomputers.\n As of September\u00a02024[update], Android is the most popular operating system with a 46% market share, followed by Microsoft Windows at 26%, iOS and iPadOS at 18%, macOS at 5%, and Linux at 1%. Android, iOS, and iPadOS are mobile operating systems, while Windows, macOS, and Linux are desktop operating systems.[3] Linux distributions are dominant in the server and supercomputing sectors. Other specialized classes of operating systems (special-purpose operating systems),[4][5] such as embedded and real-time systems, exist for many applications. Security-focused operating systems also exist. Some operating systems have low system requirements (e.g. light-weight Linux distribution). Others may have higher system requirements.\n Some operating systems require installation or may come pre-installed with purchased computers (OEM-installation), whereas others may run directly from media (i.e. live CD) or flash memory (i.e. a LiveUSB from a USB stick).\n An operating system is difficult to define,[6] but has been called \"the layer of software that manages a computer's resources for its users and their applications\".[7] Operating systems include the software that is al",

      "title": "What is Meant by AGI? On the Definition of Artificial General Intelligence",
      "summary": "This paper aims to establish a consensus on AGI\u2019s definition. General intelligence refers to the adaptation to open environments according to certain principles using limited resources. It emphasizes that adaptation or learning is an indispensable property of intelligence, and places the controversial part within the principles of intelligence, which can be described from different perspectives. Why do we take this philosophical question so seriously? It is neither because broad interests in Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) have raised\u00a0[9] over the years, nor because of any endeavors for the right to use the term AGI. Rather, what intelligence means and what AGI means are the most fundamental questions of AGI research, though these two questions are highly related. Almost all questions and debates on AGI can be guided to asking the definition of AGI, such as \u201cis AGI possible to realize?\u201d, \u201chow to realize AGI?\u201d, \u201cis that thing an AGI system?\u201d, \u201chow to evaluate AGI?\u201d, \u201cwhether will AGI save humanity or destroy it?\u201d, and so forth. Leaving the plentiful questions aside, in this paper, we focus on the question \u201cwhat is meant by AGI?\u201d, aiming to give a clear definition, and attempting to end the lack of specification of the term \u201cAGI\u201d. In the past, researchers did not make a clear definition of AGI, but it does not mean that AGI can be defined in arbitrary ways. There are some previous descriptions of AGI: AGI is the initial and ultimate goal of AI research; \u201cAGI\u201d refers to the original \u201cAI\u201d at the inception of the field of artificial intelligence; AGI systems should not be designed for specific problems, but they are general-purposed systems without designers\u2019 or developers\u2019 specifying problems to be solved by the systems; AGI systems are general systems instead of general algorithms, meaning that after deployed, no human developers need to intervene in the source code of the system, by contrast, an algorithm is general in the sense that human developers can apply i",
